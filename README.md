# PM01: Site visit

For Project Milestone 01, schedule a site visit with your service learning customer (the community partner you will be working for). The goal of the site visit is to learn more about the organization you will be working with. To truly develop a software application for your customer, you must understand the customer's work, including the people they work with (their customers), the product or service they are producing, and the purpose of the work. 

## Deliverables

Push to this repository by Friday, January 17th with:

1. We have agreed to meet with our customer on Friday, January 17th during normal class time.
2. Here are the questions we are planning on asking during our meeting:
    1. What do you do on a daily basis?
    2. How many donations do you typically get in a month?
    3. What days are best for you to meet?
    4. What information are you wanting to be in the database?
    5. How are you wanting to utilize this information?
3. We will be meeting with Jennifer Lainhart.
4. The location of Hope's Wings is in Richmond, Kentucky. There is not a physical address on Google - we assume due to safety reasons - but Jennifer has given us directions and a phone number to contact in case we get lost.
